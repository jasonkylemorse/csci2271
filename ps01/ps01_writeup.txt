This program is an implementation of a finite state machine. It reads in a line of characters using the getLine function and saves them somewhere in the stack. The machine will scan through each character of the input and set j equal to the current index when a ‘/’ is detected. If the program successfully reaches the state where a close comment, ‘*/’ is detected, then another marker, k, will be set equal to the slash character’s index. 
These indexes help determine the new size of the character sequence after the comment is replaced with a single space. Additionally, at this close character state, the program calls a function called switcharoo, which moves everything after the ‘close comment’ back such that it follows immediately after the content before the ‘start comment’. 
Now that all the data has been moved to it’s correct location, the program calls printLine using the same address but with a new size. This program will not return an error if a quotation mark isn’t closed. All other cases seem to be working.
